 Docker	
     - Dockerization is the process of packing,deploying and running the application using Docker containers.
     - Docker is an open-source tool to ship the application with all the necessary functionalities as one package.
     - A Docker will pack the application with all the functionalities (i.e, libraries) and ship it in one package (i.e, container). Containers are created from the 
	images that specifies the content.
     - There are two parts of Docker :
	     - The Docker Engine :- a portable packaging tool
	     - The Docker Hub :- a cloud service for sharing application
     - Docker simplifies the way of deploying application by not distributing the sourse code instead it sends the binary image of part of the disk. It runs the
       application unmodified on any cloud. 
     - Docker containers are sand-boxed environments(isolated VMs) that runs on kernel.

*************Docker Commands*************
# docker --version : to check the version of docker installed in the system
# docker build -t <'.jar file'> . 				     :- to build an image
# docker image ls 						     :- to check the list of created images
# docker run -p <'docker port no'>:<'app port no.'> <'.jar file'>    :- to run the jar file
# docker compose up -d <'java_db'>  				     :- to run the container    ['java_db' is the name you give for db configurations]
# docker ps -a    						     :- to check if container is running or not
# docker compose build   					     :- to build an image with docker_compose.yml file
# docker compose up 						     :- to run all the container

#clean package -DskipTests : to skip tests while building jar file   :- to build jar/war file by skipping test cases
